  <p>This is a video of my roller coaster.<br>
  I found a mod called When Dungeons Arise that adds in dungeons that looks super cool.<br>
  This one is called the Guns and Roses building.<br>
  The blimp was also from the mod but it spawned inside the building.<br>
  It shoulc have been seperate but it got glitched.<br>
  The roller coaster it self is not the main atraction.<br>
  The building is the main center piece.<br>
  Ending with a sign that says you stink, because that is funny.</p>

 Ceviche is a delicious dish that is full of shrimp and cucumber, with a hint of lemon and lime juice.<br>
 It is a seafood soup of amazing ingredients that when put together make quite possibly the best dish in the world.<br>
 It has a strong taste of fresh shrimp, cucumber, and lime. With hints of cilantro, onions, tomatoes, salt, and onion.<br>
 Some people tend to enjoy adding avocados, to enhance the taste. Some people even add in some peppers, to make it spicy.<br>
 My family however tends to add ketchup because they like the way the ketchup tastes with the salt and shrimp.<br>
 This amazing dish can be served in two main ways.<br>
 The first way, and most common, is in a bowl with the soup it was made in and eaten with a spoon.<br>
 The second way is when ceviche is on a tostada, the tostada is used like a plate for a smaller portion of the dish.<br>
 This absolutely delicious meal is an amazing dish year-round, perfect for any event.<br><br>
 
 My family has been making ceviche since I can remember.<br>
 They love the taste of ceviche, so we have it at almost every major event my family goes to. <br>
 Thankfully, no one in my family is allergic to anything in ceviche. <br>
 We love how it tastes and how easy it is to make. With only 8 ingredients, it is probably one of the cheaper dishes that we can make for a party.<br>
 My family doesn't make a special kind of ceviche, this means i can get some of my favorite dishes from any Mexican restaurant. <br>
 One particular thing about ceviche is its rich aroma of tomatoes and lemon. <br>
 Sometimes when it's made in a batch too big it can tend to smell like a garden full of tomato, cilantro, lemon, and a hint of onions.<br>
 I like ceviche with some ketchup too because I like the taste of tomatoes to have a stronger effect than the onions.<br><br>
 
 The history of ceviche is not very complex. The dish originates from the ancient Incas, which is now Peru and Ecuador.<br>
 The ceviche was a common dish back then, like burgers nowadays. <br>
 Mostly everyone in the villages was able to make it.<br>
 This is because Peru has an amazing beachside, that has half of its border.<br>
 The ceviche was more like a dish that everyone at least knew how to make. <br>
 Later it was then taken to the lower parts of the United States. <br>
 And started to blend in with Mexican culture it became more of a restaurant or party food. <br>
 Seeing as how it was harder to get fresh shrimp, and ceviche only last for 2 days before going bad. <br>
 Furthermore, when it was made in Mexico they made it slightly differently than how it's made in Peru. <br>
 Most cultures use the same dish but just with different garnishing. <br>
 However, in Mexico ceviche is served more like a soup with all of the ingredients being eaten.<br>
 It is also sometimes served on top of a tostada. <br>
 This makes it easier to eat and can be consumed quickly with little to no mess. <br>
 Since then it has been embedded in Mexican and Peruvian culture. 
 One time, when I was at my cousin's fourteenth birthday party, one of my tios had gotten really drunk and was trying to fight the bowl of ceviche because he thought he saw a face in it. 
 He was yelling out some really weird stuff, like "HEY GET OUT THE SOUP!". 
 The thing he thought was a face turned out to be some avocado that formed a smiley face. 
 But even after he figured out that it wasn't a face, he continued to yell out all this crazy stuff and threaten the bowl the ceviche was in while my cousins and Tios were laughing their butts off.
 He was about to start throwing hands with the bowl because he got mad that he was yelling at it and blamed it on the bowl. 
 Thankfully, my grandma got him away from the pot before he tried to fight all the food, all because some food looked at him the wrong way. 
 Obviously, this was an odd scene, which is why it was so funny to me.<br><br>
 
 Another time, my tia had gotten really sick, so my little cousins tried making her some soup.<br>
 But, they didn't know how to make soup, and the closest thing that they knew how to make was ceviche. <br>
 The kids were good at making ceviche, don't get me wrong, but they are masters at making messes. <br>
 So, by the time they had finished, the kitchen looked like a tornado had gone through it. <br>
 And they didn't care in the least, they just wanted to show their mother their culinary creation. <br>
 However, they decided to give it to her in bed, like a breakfast in bed. <br>
 The only thing was, they were three uncoordinated kids. <br>
 So by the time they actually got to their mom's room, a lot of the juice had ended up on their carpet and the rest of it had ended up on their mother.<br>
 Their mom was super mad at them but was so sick that she couldn't do anything even if she wanted to. <br>
 Miraculously, they only got a warning about not bringing food to the rooms. <br>
 Later, when their mom went down to check on them, she saw what happened to her kitchen, grounded them, and told them that "their behavior was unacceptable and that she should never have to wake up to something like this ever again". <br>
 They were so close to getting off nearly scott free. <br>
 If only they hadn't absolutely destroyed the kitchen, they would have had to clean it all up.<br><br>
 
 Another funny thing that happened was when my grandpa lost a little wager he had with my grandma and had to do some of her chores for a bit. <br>
 He was making the family something for dinner, and he decided to make us ceviche because he was a really bad chef. <br>
 The only thing is, he doesn't really like lemon, so he decided to try making his ceviche without the lemon. <br>
 However, he didn't know that the acid in the lemon is what cooks the shrimp. <br>
 So he ended up serving us raw and unflavored shrimp. <br>
 My family told him that it was disgusting and he didn't seem to get the hint. <br>
 My dumb little cousin thought we were just being mean, so he decided to try something, and he got food poisoning because it was raw. <br>
 So now my grandpa isn't allowed to make us food. <br>
 Now that I think about it, I don't know if he actually didn't know what he was doing or if he knew exactly what he was doing and just wanted a good excuse to get out of having to cook.<br><br>
 
 I have always loved ceviche, but it was only ever for special occasions and after parties. <br>
 Because of that, I always considered it a rare delicacy to have some. <br>
 But sometimes my tia makes me ceviche because that is how she shows her love, making food for her family.
