      My name is Gilbert Torres, I learned HTML in my freshman year, and Python in my sophomore year. I have not used HTML since freshmanyear but ive been using Python regularly, so I decided to refresh my skills in HTML with this portfolio as a challenge. I really enjoyed making this HTML portfolio as I not only relearned some HTML concepts but also got to showcase my coding skills in a creative way. As well as with this project I have found new skills for using html to improve my website. For example, I used HTML to create an interactive form on my portfolio where visitors can view the code of my projects. I did this by using a live gist from github and embededing it into my portfolio, after which I learned how to style it to fit my portfolios colors.

This is my sophomore project for a product that would help myself and others. The general idea was an app that I could use to save my recipes. I used Python with packages like tkinter for the GUI and mysqlite for the database to store recipes. I wanted to display the recipes in a grid similar to Instagram but without the images, so I implemented the use of a scroll wheel. However, after the project I found that it had issues with layering underneath the main title and buttons rather unattractively. Code-wise it was an amazing project that allowed me to stretch beyond just what was taught in class since I taught myself the database schema and functions. The entire project came out to around 400 lines of code, although truth be told a majority of it came from the 160 lines dedicated to the color-changing functions and colorways.

The "+" button creates a new window where the user can input their recipes' names, ingredient lists, and instructions. After the user inserts their recipe, the button that says "add" will add the recipe as a button to the grid and save it in the database. In the image on the left you'll see how the new recipe page has a spot for a recipe name and spaces for the ingredients and for the directions. On the right is an example of a recipe for Bag S'mores, with an edit and remove button that allows users to commit changes and to remove recipes.
